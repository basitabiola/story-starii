Napoleon and Josephine
Napoleon became a general at a very young age and was put in a 
position of authority where the generals and almost all other officers he commanded were
 older than him. He felt that this wasn't a satisfactory situation and concluded that
  if he married a woman older than himself, he might claim to be older than 
  <P></P>he actually was and thereby obtain a little more respect from his officers.
  <P></P> He also wanted to marry a rich, older woman. After the battle of Toulon and
   after saving the Directory from the Paris mob, Napoleon was invited to a party
    given by one of the Directors, Paul Barras. In effect, Barras was the next best thing to 
    being king of France at the time. Barras envisioned using Napoleon's military talents for
    <P></P> his own political and personal benefit. Barras also had at that time a 
    mistress that he wanted to get rid of (Marie-Josephe-Rose de Beauharnais) because he had
     decided to take her best friend as his new mistress and couldn't afford to keep both.
     <P></P> He knew that Napoleon was looking for a wife. He therefore decided to marry his
      mistress off to Napoleon; however, he didn't tell her this. He just told her that he
       wanted her to entertain Napoleon at the party and show an interest in him and praise
       <P></P> his military skills. Well, this was all Napoleon needed.
        A beautiful woman fawning over him, apparently well to do,
         a member of the old aristocracy that had escaped the guillotine,
          she was older than himself but not too much (he thought),
          <P></P> and she displayed keen interest in him (he thought).
           This, and a little urging from Barras after the party, was 
           all that Napoleon needed to pursue her hand in marriage.
            Barras assured Napoleon that she had money, that she was a good catch,
             and that she would make a perfect wife for him. Napoleon began to pursue Rose.
             <P></P> By the way, he didn't like her name so he told her he would call her 
             Josephine. He pursued and pursued and Josephine kept humoring him. Finally, 
             Barras strongly advised her to marry Napoleon. She said she would not.
             <P></P> Then Barras told her that he had a new mistress, that he couldn't 
             afford to maintain them both, that she was very expensive to maintain,
              and that if she didn't marry Napoleon he would stop providing for her and
               she would, in effect, be thrown out on the street. This was the one thing
                that Josephine couldn't bear. She was a compulsive spender.
                 Another concern was her two children, Eugene and Hortense.
                  Therefore, she gave in and agreed to marry Napoleon.
                  <P></P> By the way, she was much older than Napoleon thought and,
                   although she said she was still of child bearing age,
                    knew that she was barren and had been so for some time.
                     They were married and a few days later Napoleon departed to Italy.
                     <P></P> He genuinely loved Josephine at this time.
                      She despised him and thought he was a total bore.
                       As soon as he was gone she began playing around on him.
                        As time went on she had a string of lovers, pretended to miss 
                        him very much in response to his daily love letters, and did
                         everything in her power to avoid going to join him in Italy as 
                         he was constantly urging. She even went so far as to pretend she 
                         was pregnant and couldn't travel. All this time she was attending
                          balls and parties and committing adultery. From time to time, 
                          <P></P>when Napoleon begged her to join him, she required Barras
                          ' assistance to convince Napoleon that she should not go.
                           During this time some of Napoleon's officers, Murat, for
                            example, had returned to Paris for one reason or another
                             and had occasion to attend one of Josephine's parties or
                              a party that she attended. In Murat's case, Napoleon had
                               sent him back to Paris with the express mission of
                                escorting Josephine to Italy, willingly or unwillingly.
                                 This was when Josephine made up the pregnancy story,
                                  which Murat "took" back to Napoleon instead of Josephine.
                                   While in Paris, Murat also heard all the gossip about
                                    Josephine and how she was making a fool out of Napoleon.
                                     Finally, it got to the point where Napoleon was getting
                                      so edgy that Barras was afraid he would return to France
                                       and forget about the Italian Campaign. This didn't suit
                                        Barras because he was making a lot of money out of that
                                        
                                        <P></P>campaign. So he ordered Josephine to go to Napoleon.
                                        
                                        &nbsp   
                                        She did.
                                         Napoleon expected a pregnant Josephine. When she arrived 
                                         she explained to him that she had had a miscarriage.
                                          He was torn with grief over losing his "son." Anyway,
                                           the Italian Campaign was finally over and Napoleon 
                                           returned to Paris. Josephine had to be good 
                                           (or at least try to be better) while he was there.
                                            Then Napoleon decided to go to Egypt. Barras thought 
                                            this was a good idea because Napoleon was beginning to 
                                            become too popular. When he left, Josephine went back 
                                            to her old ways. Napoleon was still genuinely in love 
                                            with her and doted over her. On 19 July 1798, while
                                            <p></p> marching toward Cairo in the scorching sun, 
                                            Bourrienne, Napoleon's Secretary, out of the corner of 
                                            his eye, noticed Napoleon and Junot walking together.
                                             Bourrienne wrote, "I noticed Bonaparte walking alone
                                              with Junot. I was
